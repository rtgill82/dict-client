    <h1>DICT Client</h1>
    <p>DICT Client looks up words on public internet dictionary host servers
    that support the <a href='http://www.dict.org'>DICT protocol</a>. A number
    of these hosts are available on the internet, some providing unique
    dictionaries and reference databases. Selected hosts have been
    preconfigured, but it's possible to find and add your own as well.

    <p>Bandwidth requirements are low so this app is great if you have a
    limited data plan and a web search could possibly use up a good chunk of
    your allocated bandwidth when all you want to do is quickly look something
    up.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Simply touch the <b><i>Enter a word</i></b> search field to pull up the
    touch keyboard and type in the word you would like to look up. Then touch
    the <b><i>Search</i></b> icon on the keyboard to look up the word.  By
    default all dictionaries on the currently selected host will be searched.
    Specific dictionaries may be searched by selecting one from the dictionary
    pull-down menu just below the <b><i>Enter a word</i></b> search field. The
    <b><i>i</i></b> icon next to the dictionary pull-down menu will display
    information about the currently selected dictionary, if one is selected.

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>Definition search results are displayed in the main section of the
    screen and are organized by originating dictionary. Each section of words
    and definitions are prefixed by their originating dictionary in bold.
    Related words are underlined and highlighted in blue. These can be touched
    to look up the definition of the highlighted word using the currently
    selected dictionary on the currently selected host.

    <p>Example Result:</p>
    <b>WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006)</b><br>
    arboretum<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;n 1: a facility where trees and shrubs are cultivated for
    exhibition [syn: <font color='blue'><u>arboretum</u></font>,
    <font color='blue'><u>botanical garden</u></font>]

    <h3>History Navigation</h3>
    <p>When multiple words are searched for or are navigated to by touching
    highlighted words within the displayed definitions, then previously viewed
    definitions can be returned to by using the arrow navigation buttons at the
    top of the screen. These work much like the forward and back buttons on a
    web browser.

    <h3>Menu Items</h3>
    <p>Other than the navigation buttons, the following options are available
    via the menu.

    <p><i>Select Host</i> - Temporarily select another DICT host without
    changing the default.  May appear as a bookmark icon on devices with wide
    screens.

    <p><i>Refresh Dictionaries</i> - Force retrieval of the available
    dictionaries from the currently selected host. Usually dictionaries will
    only be retrieved when the dictionary cache timeout has been exceeded.

    <p><i>Settings</i> - Application settings.

    <p><i>Help</i> - Display this help documentation.

    <p><i>About</i> - About the application and donation button.

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>

    <p><i>Default Host</i> - Set the default DICT host to use for searches.

    <p><i>Dictionary Cache Timeout</i> - How often available dictionaries will
    be retrieved from the current DICT host. Defaults to 7 days.

    <h3>Manage Hosts</h3>
    <p>The manage hosts section of the settings allows you to add, edit, and
    delete your own DICT hosts. Preconfigured hosts are not editable, but may
    be removed.

    <p>The <i>plus</i> icon will open a dialog allowing you to add a new host.
    The dialog contains 3 fields, all of which are required.

    <p><i>Host Name</i> - The domain name address of the host.

    <p><i>Port</i> - The port number of the host (default: 2628)

    <p><i>Description</i> - A short description of the host, the kinds of
    dictionaries it provides, etc.

    <p>Touch and hold a host to bring up the edit dialog. The edit dialog
    behaves exactly as the add host dialog.

    <p>When hosts are checked the <i>delete</i> icon will become active.
    Touching it will delete all selected hosts.
