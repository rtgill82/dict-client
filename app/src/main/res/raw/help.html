    <h1>DICT Client</h1>
    <p>DICT Client looks up words on public internet dictionary servers that
    support the <a href='http://www.dict.org'>DICT protocol</a>. A number of
    these servers are available on the internet, some providing unique
    dictionaries and reference databases. Selected hosts have been
    preconfigured, but it's possible to find and add your own as well.

    <p>Bandwidth requirements are low so this app is great if you have a
    limited data plan and a web search could possibly use up a good chunk of
    your allocated bandwidth when all you want to do is quickly look something
    up.

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>Simply touch the <b><i>Enter a word</i></b> search field to pull up the
    touch keyboard and type in the word you would like to look up. Then touch
    the <b><i>Search</i></b> icon on the keyboard to look up the word. By
    default all dictionaries on the currently selected host will be searched.
    Specific dictionaries may be searched by selecting one from the dictionary
    pull-down menu just below the <b><i>Enter a word</i></b> search field. The
    <b><i>i</i></b> icon next to the dictionary pull-down menu will display
    information about the currently selected dictionary, if one is selected.

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>Definition search results are displayed in the main section of the
    screen and are organized by originating dictionary. Each section of words
    and definitions are prefixed by their originating dictionary in bold.
    Related words are underlined and highlighted in blue. These can be touched
    to look up the definition of the highlighted word using the currently
    selected dictionary on the currently selected host.

    <p>Example Result:</p>
    <b>WordNet (r) 3.0 (2006)</b><br>
    arboretum<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;n 1: a facility where trees and shrubs are cultivated for
    exhibition [syn: <font color='blue'><u>arboretum</u></font>,
    <font color='blue'><u>botanical garden</u></font>]

    <h3>History Navigation</h3>
    <p>When multiple words are searched for or are navigated to by touching
    highlighted words within the displayed definitions, then previously viewed
    definitions can be returned to by using the arrow navigation buttons at the
    top of the screen. These work much like the forward and back buttons on a
    web browser.

    <h3>Match strategies</h3>
    <p>To the right of the <b><i>Enter a word</i></b> search field is
    a pull-down menu containing available <i>match strategies</i>. Match
    strategies allow you to search the available dictionaries for similar words
    or by patterns. <i>define</i> is selected by default and will bring up the
    definitions for the currently entered word. Available strategies vary from
    host server to host server, but some of the most frequently available are
    described below.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Match headwords exactly</b></li>
      <p>An exact match.

      <li><b>Match prefixes</b></li>
      <p>Prefix match.

      <li><b>Match prefixes (skip, count)</b></li>
      <p>Like <i>prefix</i> but returns the specified range of matches. For
      example, when prefix strategy returns 1000 matches, you can get only 100
      ones skipping the first 800 matches. This is made by specifying these
      limits in a query like this: <i>800#100#app</i>, where 800 is skip count,
      100 is a number of matches you want to get and "app" is your query.

      <li><b>Match substring occurring anywhere in a headword</b></li>
      <p>Match a substring anywhere in the headword.

      <li><b>Match suffixes</b></li>
      <p>Suffix match.

      <li><b>POSIX 1003.2 (modern) regular expressions</b></li>
      <p>These regular expressions allow predefined character classes (e.g.,
      [[:alnum:]], [[:alpha:]], [[:digit:]], and [[:xdigit:]] are useful for
      this application); uses * to match a sequence 0 or more matches of the
      previous atom; uses + to match a sequence of 1 or more matches of the
      previous atom; uses ? to match a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the
      previous atom; used ^ to match the beginning of a word, uses $ to match
      the end of a word, and allows nested subexpression and alternation with
      () and |. For example, "(foo|bar)" matches all words that contain either
      "foo" or "bar". To match these special characters, they must be quoted
      with two backslashes (due to the quoting characteristics of the server).

      <li><b>Old (basic) regular expressions</b></li>
      <p>These regular expressions don't support |, +, or ?. Groups use escaped
      parentheses. While modern regular expressions are generally easier to
      use, basic regular expressions have a back reference feature. This can be
      used to match a second occurrence of something that was already matched.
      For example, the following expression finds all words that begin and end
      with the same three letters:

      <p>^\\(...\\).*\\1$

      <li><b>Match using SOUNDEX algorithm</b></li>
      <p>The Soundex algorithm, a classic algorithm for finding words that
      sound similar to each other. The algorithm encodes each word using the
      first letter of the word and up to three digits. Since the first letter
      is known, this search is relatively fast, and it sometimes good for
      correcting spelling errors when the Levenshtein algorithm doesn't help.

      <li><b>Match headwords within Levenshtein distance one</b></li>
      <p>The Levenshtein algorithm (string edit distance of one). This
      algorithm searches for all words which are within an edit distance of one
      from the target word. An "edit" means an insertion, deletion, or
      transposition.  This is a rapid algorithm for correcting spelling errors,
      since many spelling errors are within a Levenshtein distance of one from
      the original word.

      <li><b>Match separate words within headwords</b></li>
      <p>Match any single word, even if part of a multi-word entry.

      <li><b>Match the first word within headwords</b></li>
      <p>Match the first word that begins a multi-word entry.

      <li><b>Match the last word within headwords</b></li>
      <p>Match the last word that ends a multi-word entry.
    </ul>

    <h3>Menu Items</h3>
    <p>Other than the navigation buttons, the following options are available
    via the menu.

    <p><i>Select Host</i> - Temporarily select another DICT host without
    changing the default. May appear as a bookmark icon on devices with wide
    screens.

    <p><i>Refresh Dictionaries</i> - Force retrieval of the available
    dictionaries from the currently selected host. Usually dictionaries will
    only be retrieved when the dictionary cache timeout has been exceeded.

    <p><i>Settings</i> - Application settings.

    <p><i>Help</i> - Display this help documentation.

    <p><i>About</i> - About the application and donation button.

    <h2>Settings</h2>
    <h3>General</h3>

    <p><i>Default Host</i> - Set the default DICT host to use for searches.

    <p><i>Word Wrap</i> - Word wrap definition results when displaying them
    rather than attempting to scale them to fit. This may be necessary if the
    results contain any abnormally long lines. Defaults to <i>false</i>.

    <p><i>Dictionary Cache Timeout</i> - How often available dictionaries will
    be retrieved from the current DICT host. Defaults to 7 days.

    <h3>Manage Hosts</h3>
    <p>The manage hosts section of the settings allows you to add, edit, and
    delete your own DICT hosts. Preconfigured hosts are not editable, but may
    be removed.

    <p>The <i>plus</i> icon will open a dialog allowing you to add a new host.
    The dialog contains 3 fields, all of which are required.

    <p><i>Host Name</i> - The domain name address of the host.

    <p><i>Port</i> - The port number of the host (default: 2628)

    <p><i>Description</i> - A short description of the host, the kinds of
    dictionaries it provides, etc.

    <p>Touch and hold a host to bring up the edit dialog. The edit dialog
    behaves exactly as the add host dialog.

    <p>When hosts are checked the <i>delete</i> icon will become active.
    Touching it will delete all selected hosts.
